# Task 8 - VPN Setup Report

## VPN Used:
Windscribe Free Version

## Steps Performed:
1. Installed Windscribe VPN.
2. Connected to a server (Romania).
3. Checked IP address before and after connection.
4. Verified that IP address changed.
5. Browsed websites while connected.

## Observations:
- Original IP was from Ahmedabad, India.
- After VPN connection, IP changed to Romania.
- Website detected VPN usage.
- Internet speed slightly reduced.

## Conclusion:
VPN hides the real IP address and encrypts internet traffic.
It improves privacy but does not guarantee complete anonymity.
